# OPS

## Monitoring

Minimum alerts:

- Gateway `/healthz` or `/readyz` non-200 for more than 5 minutes.
- Any service restart loop.
- Postgres volume above 80 percent.
- Certificate expiry under 30 days.
- Support bundle generation failure.
- Audit or Veil Witness write errors.

Kubernetes installs should also alert on unavailable replicas, HPA maxed out for more than 15 minutes, and denied network-policy traffic that indicates unexpected cross-zone access.

## Logs

Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.customer.yml --env-file customer.env logs --tail 300 gateway
docker compose -f docker-compose.customer.yml --env-file customer.env logs --tail 300 sanitizer
docker compose -f docker-compose.customer.yml --env-file customer.env logs --tail 300 veil-witness
```

Kubernetes:

```bash
kubectl logs -n dsa-edge deploy/gateway --tail=300
kubectl logs -n dsa-identity deploy/sandbox-a --tail=300
kubectl logs -n dsa-witness deploy/veil-witness --tail=300
```

## Backups

Back up these volumes or databases:

- `pg-audit-data`
- `pg-bridge-data`
- `pg-sandbox-a-data`
- `postgres-veil-data`
- `gateway-data`
- `cert-store` when certification is enabled

Recommended minimum:

- Nightly encrypted database backups.
- 30-day retention.
- Quarterly restore test.
- Backup encryption key held outside the Lucairn host.

## Key Rotation

Rotate in this order:

1. Upstream provider keys.
2. Gateway API keys.
3. Internal service token.
4. Database passwords.
5. Veil signing keys with a planned verification window.
6. `GATEWAY_KEYSTORE_KEY` only with a coordinated re-encryption migration.

Do not rotate all Veil keys at once. Keep retired public keys available through the witness-signed manifest retention window.

## Scaling

Scale stateless services first:

- Gateway
- Sanitizer
- Sandbox B workers for full self-hosted Kubernetes deployments

Scale databases vertically before sharding. For Compose installs, move to Kubernetes before adding multi-host complexity.

## Upgrade

1. Read release notes.
2. Take database backups.
3. Run `bin/lucairn doctor`.
4. Pull images or update Helm values.
5. Apply the release.
6. Confirm `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and one synthetic inference request.
7. Generate a support bundle and archive it internally as upgrade evidence.
